        <p>Seavey set many records competing in the Iditarod this year. His victory marked his third consecutive win and fourth in five years, losing only to his father, and he also set a new record by finishing the race in the fastest time. But the more interesting record he broke involved the number of dogs he crossed the finish line with. After beginning the 1,000 mile race across Alaska with 16 dogs, Seavey crossed the finish line with just six dogs, erasing the record he set the year before finish the race with seven dogs.

        <p>A little over a month ago, a young German Shepherd named Luna fell of a fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean, and after searching for a couple of days without any sight of her, Luna was presumed dead. Fortunately though, she was recently spotted by Navy officials on an island off the coast of San Diego, CA, and has since been reunited with her owner and declared to be in extremely good conditions.

Ten of the dogs are set to be adopted and in due time all should be set to be released.

        <p>Scientists recently thawed out a frozen dog that was found in the ice of Siberia.

It is thought to be a now-extinct species, and it was so well preserved in the ice that it still has a fully intact brain. This is by far one of the best preserved ancient dogs ever discovered.

        <p>Two lovable canines named Pikelet and Patty Cakes wanted nothing more than their own little ducklings. Their owners decided to foster a pair of chicks, named Penguin and Popinjay, to bring the dogs’ dreams to life. The dogs quickly understood how gentle and fragile the ducks are, so they treat them with care and tenderness. All day they protect the chicks like their own, basically taking them under their wings.

        <p>Truffles are known as one of the most expensive foods in the world, but a unique farm in Australia is making the harvest easier and saving some animals in the process.

It is a wonderful combination of saving the otherwise helpless dogs and putting their natural talents to use.

These are not scientifically proven but simply formed from the trends. Follow the link to see the complete list of which dogs are actually most adopted.
